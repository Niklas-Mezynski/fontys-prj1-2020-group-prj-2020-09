                    <h1> Introduction:</h1>
                    <p>Thanks for choosing Songify (“Songify,” “we,” “us,” “our”). Songify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for 
                       streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time. 
                       By signing up or otherwise using any of these Songify services, including all associated features and functionalities, 
                       websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services 
                       (collectively, the “Songify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is 
                       made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Songify Netherlands Inc.
                       Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement 
                       section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”). The Agreements include terms regarding 
                       future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, 
                       and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective 
                       version of the Agreements can be found on Songify’s website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these 
                       Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Songify 
                       Service or access any Content. In order to use the Songify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 16 years
                       or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding
                       contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the Netherlands. 
                       You also promise that any registration information that you submit to Songify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
                      
                      
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1> Changes to the Agreements:</h1>
                    <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances,
                       e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after 
                       the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using 
                       the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us. If you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you 
                       must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.

                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1> Service Options:</h1>
                    <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Songify account. Certain options 
                       are provided to you free-of-charge. The Songify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access 
                       them (the “Paid Subscriptions”). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through 
                       the Songify Service. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription 
                       plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1> Billing:</h1>
                    <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Songify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed 
                       to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Songify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”). Songify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, 
                       including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid) from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those 
                       changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the 
                       Songify Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change 
                       going into effect.

                        LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.
